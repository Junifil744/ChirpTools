Journey models reverse engineering

Header, i do not know much yet but I found the following
    Length of the face buffer is at address 0x00000048 of the file.
    Length of the vertex buffer is at 0x0000004C.
    They are both uint16

Data starts at 0C B1 01 02 00
Face buffer is first. Right after 0C B1 01 02 00
    Always uses uint16, always 6 bytes.
    Ends at the length defined in the header
    Also add a +1 to the face IDs, apparently starting with face ID 0 just had the shapes collapse.

Vertex buffer comes after. Right after the face buffer. No separator byte between them.
    Always 3 floats one after the other (12 bytes)
    Each file seems to have a different padding between values
        After the 3 floats, there are 8 bytes to skip ahead, after that, there are 2 half-floats, those are the U and V respectively.
       
        I found this uint8 value at an address that differs from files.
        I calculated it by looking at the last instance of the string "dae#"
        Then reading 40 bytes ahead, looking for the last instance of a 00 byte then the first instance of a non-00 byte. Shows how many bytes each vertice takes total
    Ends at the length defined in the header (Unverified)
